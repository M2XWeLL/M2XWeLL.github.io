				<div class="about"><p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;font-size: larger;"><b>The emergence of AI in the modern world</p></b><img src="his1.png" alt=""><p>The relentless march of technological progress has ushered in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a transformative force with the potential to reshape the very fabric of our economies. While AI promises advancements in efficiency, productivity, and innovation, its integration into the economic system presents a complex set of challenges that demand careful consideration. This article delves into the intricate relationship between AI and the economy, exploring the significant hurdles that lie ahead and their multifaceted effects. <br><br> The path of technological progress has produced many head-on collisions between innovation and the labor market, from the scribes put out of work by the printing press to the weavers forced to compete with mechanized looms and the factory workers displaced by robots. A.I., too, will surely shake up the labor force in meaningful ways in the coming decades. But the disruptive potential of A.I. is so apparent to so many people that this time we have an advantage absent from most of those historical experiences: a chance to do something about it.</p></div>
				<div class="about"><p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;font-size: larger;"><b>What’s different about generative A.I.?</p></b><img src="his3.png" alt=""><p>Artificial intelligence is what economists call a general-purpose technology has applications across industries and the potential to transform the broad economy. (The GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer.) And while generative A.I. has refocused public attention, the technology is, of course, hardly new. One-quarter of US companies have already adopted some form of A.I., while Chinese and Indian companies are at nearly 60 percent, according to a 2022 IBM report. <br> <br>
					
					Generative A.I. tools can identify patterns in massive data sets to create new content, including text, audio, and images. A chatbot used for customer-service purposes cannot, say, craft a movie script based on a human prompt. Generative A.I. programs could do this, along with producing what appear to be novel solutions to complex challenges.
					
					Hence the consternation of the screenwriters, as well as white-collar workers in a slew of professions previously considered untouchable <br> <br>
					
					Experts do not all agree on what does and does not constitute generative A.I., but some regard it as being a step toward artificial general intelligence—that is, a technology that is able to operate in a fully human way, perform cognitive tasks just like a person, and ultimately exceed all human capabilities.</p></div>

	        	<p class="card-text">More than 40% of labor force to be affected by AI in 3 years, Morgan Stanley forecasts. One of the most pressing questions for employers and employees alike is how and to what degree the emergence of generative artificial intelligence will change the way people work.

                    Revolutionary technologies have the power to create new economic activity and entirely new professions, and natural-language chatbots that use AI to create text, images, code and audio with human-like fluency are expected to be especially transformative.
                    
                    Generative AI—hailed as one of the most disruptive technologies since the smartphone—is expected to have wide-ranging effects on labor and the broader economy. In a recent report, Morgan Stanley Research economists gauged the groundbreaking technology’s near-term reverberations. Their conclusion: More than 40% of occupations might be affected by generative AI in the next three years.
                    
                    “It is impossible to know for sure, but current generative AI technologies could affect as much as a quarter of the occupations that exist today, meaning that AI has the potential to augment them now or in the future, with associated labor costs that could reach at most $2.1 trillion,” says Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley. “Within three years, this might rise to 44% of occupations affected and $4.1 trillion of associated labor costs.</p>

	        	<p class="card-text">An April 2023 Goldman Sachs report estimates that tech advances fueled by generative A.I. such as ChatGPT could affect approximately 300 million jobs worldwide over the next decade, and that around two-thirds of US occupations are vulnerable. Further, up to 50 percent of the workload of employees in vulnerable professions could be replaced by A.I. automation.
					That said, the report also predicts that advances in A.I. could lead to a 7 percent—nearly $7 trillion—increase in global GDP and boost productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over the next 10 years. And, the report notes, “most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by A.I.”</p>

	        	<p class="card-text">In 2020, the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2025, 85 million jobs across the globe could be displaced due to a division of labor between humans and machines—but 97 million new roles may emerge. Its 2023 report notes, “Agriculture technologies, digital platforms and apps, e-commerce and digital trade, and A.I. are all expected to result in significant labour-market disruption, with substantial proportions of companies forecasting job displacement in their organizations, offset by job growth elsewhere to result in a net positive.”</p>

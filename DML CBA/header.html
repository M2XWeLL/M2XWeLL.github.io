				<div class="about"><h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;font-size: large; margin-left: 2vw;"><b>The Emergence of AI in the Modern World</h4></b><img src="his1.png" alt=""><p>The relentless march of technological progress has ushered in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a transformative force with the potential to reshape the very fabric of our economies. While AI promises advancements in efficiency, productivity, and innovation, its integration into the economic system presents a complex set of challenges that demand careful consideration. This article delves into the intricate relationship between AI and the economy, exploring the significant hurdles that lie ahead and their multifaceted effects. <br><br> The path of technological progress has produced many head-on collisions between innovation and the labor market, from the scribes put out of work by the printing press to the weavers forced to compete with mechanized looms and the factory workers displaced by robots. A.I., too, will surely shake up the labor force in meaningful ways in the coming decades. But the disruptive potential of A.I. is so apparent to so many people that this time we have an advantage absent from most of those historical experiences: a chance to do something about it.</p></div>
				<div class="about"><h4 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;font-size: large;"><b>What’s Different about Generative A.I.?</b></h4><img src="his3.png" alt=""><p>Artificial intelligence is what economists call a general-purpose technology has applications across industries and the potential to transform the broad economy. (The GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer.) And while generative A.I. has refocused public attention, the technology is, of course, hardly new. One-quarter of US companies have already adopted some form of A.I., while Chinese and Indian companies are at nearly 60 percent, according to a 2022 IBM report. <br> <br>
					
					Generative A.I. tools can identify patterns in massive data sets to create new content, including text, audio, and images. A chatbot used for customer-service purposes cannot, say, craft a movie script based on a human prompt. Generative A.I. programs could do this, along with producing what appear to be novel solutions to complex challenges.
					
					Hence the consternation of the screenwriters, as well as white-collar workers in a slew of professions previously considered untouchable <br> <br>
					
					Experts do not all agree on what does and does not constitute generative A.I., but some regard it as being a step toward artificial general intelligence—that is, a technology that is able to operate in a fully human way, perform cognitive tasks just like a person, and ultimately exceed all human capabilities.</p></div>

	        	<h2 class="card-title">Morgan Stanley</h2>
	        	<div class="card-text"><p>More than 40% of labor force to be affected by AI in 3 years, Morgan Stanley forecasts. <br><br> 
                    Revolutionary technologies have the power to create new economic activity and entirely new professions, and natural-language chatbots that use AI to create text, images, code and audio with human-like fluency are expected to be especially transformative. <br><br>
                    Generative AI—hailed as one of the most disruptive technologies since the smartphone—is expected to have wide-ranging effects on labor and the broader economy. In a recent report, Morgan Stanley Research economists gauged the groundbreaking technology’s near-term reverberations. Their conclusion: More than 40% of occupations might be affected by generative AI in the next three years. <br><br>
                    
                    “It is impossible to know for sure, but current generative AI technologies could affect as much as a quarter of the occupations that exist today, meaning that AI has the potential to augment them now or in the future, with associated labor costs that could reach at most $2.1 trillion,” says Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley. 
					Today, Morgan Stanley pegs the AI effect at $2.1 trillion, affecting 25% of labor. Morgan Stanley sees some positive tailwinds for software companies as a result of AI adoption, estimating that software vendors could scoop up 5% of the $4.1 trillion labor effect, or a total addressable market of $205 billion over the next three years. <br><br>

					Should generative AI adoption among enterprise workloads hit 20% over the next three years, it poses a $150 billion global enterprise spending opportunity, Morgan Stanley projects.

	        	<h2 class="card-title">Goldman Sachs Report</h2>
	        	<div class="card-text"><p>An April 2023 Goldman Sachs report estimates that tech advances fueled by generative A.I. such as ChatGPT could affect approximately 300 million jobs worldwide over the next decade, and that around two-thirds of US occupations are vulnerable. Further, up to 50 percent of the workload of employees in vulnerable professions could be replaced by A.I. automation.
					<br> <br> That said, the report also predicts that advances in A.I. could lead to a 7 percent—nearly $7 trillion—increase in global GDP and boost productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over the next 10 years. Analyzing databases detailing the task content of over 900 occupations, our economists estimate that roughly two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. And, the report notes, “most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by A.I.” <br> <br>
					Added up, the Research estimates the total addressable market for generative AI software to be $150 billion, compared with $685 billion for the global software industry.</p></div>

	        	<h2 class="card-title">World Economic Forum</h2>
	        	<div class="card-text"><p>In 2020, the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2025, 85 million jobs across the globe could be displaced due to a division of labor between humans and machines—but 97 million new roles may emerge. <br><br> More than 80% of business executives are accelerating plans to digitize work processes and deploy new technologies; and 50% of employers are expecting to accelerate the automation of some roles in their companies. In contrast to previous years, job creation is now slowing while job destruction is accelerating. <br><br> Its 2023 report notes, “Agriculture technologies, digital platforms and apps, e-commerce and digital trade, and A.I. are all expected to result in significant labour-market disruption, with substantial proportions of companies forecasting job displacement in their organizations, offset by job growth elsewhere to result in a net positive.”</p></div>

	        	<div class="card-text"><p>Such predictions are backed by research from MIT’s David Autor and MIT PhD student Caroline Chin, Utrecht University’s Anna M. Salomons, and Northwestern’s Bryan Seegmiller, which finds that approximately 60 percent of jobs in the US today didn’t exist in 1940, when more than 25 percent of work was in manufacturing and nearly 20 percent in farming and mining. This research makes it even more clear, how quickly can change labour market </p></div>

		<h2 class="section-title" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;align-items: center; font-size: xxx-large;">Conclusions</h2>
		<div class="box">
		<div class="item one" style="background-image:url(10.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>Generative AI tools can enable major advancements in education, together with new
				productivity-enhancing roles for educators.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item two" style="background-image:url(2.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>The direction of AI will have profound consequences for all workers.
				Creating an institutional framework in which workers also have a voice would be a
				constructive step</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item three" style="background-image:url(3.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>It is inevitable that AI systems will be used for some automation, both for technical
				and business strategy reasons.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item big b1" style="background-image:url(3.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span style="font-size: 1vw;">Rather than wiping out jobs, A.I. could create many new ones, and make the people performing them far more productive than analogous workers are today. But if we’re going to realize the A.I.-powered future we might hope for, we have to start planning for it now.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item big b2" style="background-image:url(5.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>A.I. has made inroads in various fields, such as tech, manufacturing, healthcare, banking and financial services, media, retail, hospitality, and automaking.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item four" style="background-image:url(6.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>On the technical front, a major barrier to automation of
				many service and production tasks has been that they require flexibility, judgment,
				and common sense—things that are notably absent from pre-AI forms of automation.
				Artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, can potentially master such tasks</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item five" style="background-image:url(7.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>New technologies need not merely replace workers in existing tasks. They may also
				complement workers by enabling them to work more efficiently, perform higherquality work, or accomplish new tasks that were previously infeasible</span>
		</div>

		<div class="item six" style="background-image:url(8.jpg); padding: 2vw;">
			<span>There is no guarantee that the transformative capabilities of generative AI will be used
				for the betterment of work or workers. To redirect AI development onto the human-complementary path requires changes in
				the direction of technological innovation, as well as in corporate norms and behavior. </span>
